Marc Mennigmann (born 1970) worked as a session musician in the 1990s and founded two companies which both still exist.
He started photography for fun in the new millennium using medium format film and a Lomo camera. Later he switched to digital photography, covering everything from landscapes and architecture to people and product photography.

Currently his main interest is taking headshot portraits and shooting musicians on stage in good old black & white manner.
